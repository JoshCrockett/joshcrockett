### Hi, I'm Joshua Crockett
### I'm interested in programming, computers, gaming, and music.
### I'm currently learning about physics, math, fairytales, digital design, and object-oriented programming.
### I'm originally from Japan, but I moved to Hawaii in 2016.
### I'm currently a sophomore intending to major in Computer Engineering.
### I chose my major because I've always had an interest in computers and how they work, and pursuing a degree allows me to furfill that long-standing interest, while also opening opportunities for me.
### A fun fact about me is that my favorite video game of all time is a toss-up between Super Mario Galaxy 1/2. 1 is more atmospheric and pretty while 2 is more challenging and fun.
### I want to gain a better understanding of how to program better from EE 205, while also further dipping my toes into software engineering as well as different coding languages that I'm not familiar with.
### A book or movie that I would personally recommend to anybody whose interested in watching would be Logan. Logan is about as great of a sendoff to both FOX and the X-MEN as one could ask for, and it's a genuine shame that FOX decided that Dark Phoenix was the better film to finish on before merging with Disney.
