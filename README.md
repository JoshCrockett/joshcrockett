### Hi, I'm Joshua Crockett
### I'm interested in programming, computers, gaming, and music.
### I'm currently learning about physics, math, fairytales, digital design, and object-oriented programming.
### I'm originally from Japan, but I moved to Hawaii in 2016.
### I'm currently a sophomore intending to major in Computer Engineering.
### I chose my major because I've always had an interest in computers and how they work, and pursuing a degree allows me to furfill that long-standing interest, while also opening opportunities for me.
### A fun fact about me is that my favorite video game of all time is a toss-up between Super Mario Galaxy 1/2. 1 is more atmospheric and pretty, 2 is more challenging and fun.
